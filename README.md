Ground Station:
There is still some weird stuff going on with the recceive. The messages are split up and sent separately slower than they are received. Kind of weird but it is receiving the messages correctly

  Ground Station Operation Instructions:
    1.	Plug the meshtastic device into the furthest USB port on the USB splitter. The USB splitter plugs into the power port in the middle of the device.
    2.	Plug in the raspberry piâ€™s power to the power port closest to the edge of the device. This will be plugged into a battery bank.
    3.	It should send a file every minute to the phone which is identified in the code.
  How to change which phone it is connected to:
    1.	Power the raspberry pi, connect keyboard and mouse, and monitor. Wait for raspberry pi to boot to the desktop. (Not windows, running a version of Linux)
    2.	Click on file icon in top left.
    3.	Navigate to /users/vaughn/documents/send_file.py
    4.	Edit MAC Address in quotation marks to desired MAC address
  How to find your MAC address:
    1.	When in the desktop click on Bluetooth icon
    2.	Pair phone
    3.	Click on connected device details
    4.	MAC address of the device should be listed
